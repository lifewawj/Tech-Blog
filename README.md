# Tech-Blog

## Description

As developers, continual learning and adapting to evolving technologies are integral to our growth. Documenting our journey through a website, where we discuss lessons and challenges, not only enables us to articulate our thoughts and opinions but also provides a valuable record of our progress. Looking back on our past posts allows us to appreciate the distance we've covered and the skills we've acquired.

## What I have learned

Still in progress, but I have learned so far how the MVC framework works and how it connects! As well as being able to use the handlebars with my Express server.

## Credits

I have rewatched my pre-recorded classes of learning about MVC "Model View Controller", and used the activities in the UCSD (University of California San Diego) MVC folder section to help me with this project. Along with watching MVC, handlebars, and Sequalized videos on YouTube to help better my understanding, and reading documentation.
